📌 Project Overview: "TrendPulse" (Premium Product Research Tool)
A SaaS platform that identifies top-selling products on Shopify (via scraping) + eBay (via API), helping e-commerce sellers find winning items to sell.

🎯 Core Purpose
Solve: Dropshippers/resellers struggle to find trending products manually.

Offer: Automated daily reports on hottest items across Shopify/eBay.

Monetize: Freemium model (free preview → paid full access).

✨ Key Features
1. Data Collection Engine
Shopify: Scrape public stores for:

Bestseller tags, pricing, inventory changes.

eBay: Use official API to fetch:

completedItems (sold listings), mostWatched items.

2. Dashboard (User-Facing)
Daily Trending Products: Ranked by sales velocity.

Cross-Platform Comparison:

3. Monetization Layers

10−30/month): Full access + CSV exports.

🔧 How It Works
Backend (Python):

Scrapes Shopify stores (rotating proxies to avoid bans).

Pulls eBay data via API (5,000 free calls/month).

Analyzes trends (e.g., "Y2K fashion spiking 200% this week").

Frontend (Next.js):

Displays trends in a clean dashboard (charts, filters).

Handles user auth + Stripe payments.

Automation:

Runs daily scrapes via GitHub Actions/AWS Lambda.

⚖️ Legal & Ethical Notes
Shopify: Only scrape public data (no brute-forcing logins).

eBay: Stay within free API limits (5,000 calls/month).

Disclaimer: "Data sourced from public listings; comply with platform policies."
