TAVARI – The Intelligent Agent Hub
"Tavari is your digital workforce. Build your team of AI agents, assign tasks, and let them collaborate."

🚀 1. WHAT IS TAVARI?
Tavari is a unified platform where users can:

Build and manage smart AI agents

Assign them tasks in natural language

Let agents collaborate, learn, and evolve

Tap into a growing library of plug-and-play agents

Eventually create and publish their own agents into the Tavari ecosystem

Think:

“Slack + OpenAI + Shopify App Store”
but instead of people or apps — it’s autonomous AI agents.

🧩 2. CORE CONCEPTS
🧑‍💼 Tavari Agents:
Each agent is:

A specialized AI persona (e.g., “Kai – Social Media Agent”)

Has a name, role, and memory

Can be taught and improved over time

Can collaborate with other agents (multi-agent systems)

🧠 Agent Intelligence Includes:
Task reasoning

Step-by-step execution

Feedback loop for improvement

Communication between agents (“Kai” can ask “Nora” to generate copy)

🖥️ 3. PLATFORM STRUCTURE
Layer	What It Does
Agent Dashboard	Central place where users see all active agents and their task history
Task Command UI	You give commands like “Send a DM campaign to new followers” — agents handle it
Agent Store (future)	Browse new agents made by others and install with one click
Agent Memory Layer	Agents remember user preferences, tone, and past tasks
Agent Studio (phase 2)	Developers or power users can create & publish their own Tavari agents

🧪 4. MVP SCOPE (What We Build First)
✅ Agents (Prebuilt)
Kai – Social Media Outreach Agent

Nora – Copywriting / Content Agent

Lex – Analytics Agent

Each can:

Be assigned a task

Respond in chat

Save task logs to memory

✅ Features (V1)
Feature	Description
Agent Cards	UI showing each agent like a digital teammate
Task Input	Send task instructions via natural language
Response Log	Agents reply with step-by-step plan or results
Task Memory	Agents remember previous tasks and adapt
Status Reports	Agents can be asked: “What have you done today?”

🛠️ 5. TECH STACK RECOMMENDATION
Frontend (React + TypeScript with Vite)
Clean agent dashboard

Tailwind + shadcn/ui for modern UI

Backend (NestJS + PostgreSQL via Supabase)
Agent controller logic

User/task/agent memory schema

Agent-to-agent communication bus (via WebSockets or polling)

AI Integration
OpenAI GPT-4o for agent cognition

Embeddings for memory (via Supabase or Pinecone)

Vector search for remembering tasks, tone, goals

🧠 6. USER EXPERIENCE FLOW (MVP)
User signs up

Gets a workspace with 3 default agents (Kai, Nora, Lex)

User says:

“Kai, message 20 new followers about our launch.”

Kai responds:

“Sure. I’ll draft and send 20 DMs now. I’ll report when done.”

Lex can be asked:

“How did that campaign perform?”

Memory: Next time, Kai adapts tone/style based on past results.

TAVARI – The AI Agent Workspace
“Your digital team. One interface. Infinite intelligence.”

🧬 What is Tavari?
Tavari is an AI operating environment where users interact with a team of intelligent agents through a shared, chat-based workspace.

Instead of giving instructions one by one, users can:

Talk to all their agents at once

Use @[agent] mentions like in Slack

Chain tasks: "Write, send, track, and log — all in one message"

Watch their AI team collaborate autonomously to get things done

🚀 Core Value Proposition
You don’t use AI tools — you command your own digital team.

Tavari replaces the idea of “a single chatbot” with a workspace full of role-based AI agents that:

Have defined personalities and specialties

Collaborate just like human coworkers

Log everything automatically

Learn and evolve with you

🔑 What Makes Tavari Unique?
Feature	Why It’s Special
🧑‍💻 Multi-agent chat system	Like Slack, but your coworkers are AI agents
🤖 @-Mention task routing	One message can activate and coordinate multiple agents
🧠 Role-based personalities	Each agent has a defined role, style, and behavior
🔁 Chained task execution	Agents can pass tasks to each other automatically
📋 Echo logging system	One agent logs everything your team does
📦 Memory + history	See your team’s past work, recall old tasks, reuse responses
🧱 Modular agent system	Plug-and-play new agents (e.g., Designer, Editor, Researcher) in the future

💬 Example Use Case: “Launch Campaign”
You send:

less
Copy
Edit
@[nora] write a 600-word article about Tavari and send it to @[kai], then @[kai] post it on LinkedIn and X. After that, @[lex] should track performance and let @[echo] log the data.
And Tavari does:

✅ Nora writes the article

📤 Kai receives and posts it

📈 Lex analyzes reactions after posting

🧠 Echo logs the full thread, timestamp, and outputs

All of this happens in a shared chat interface, and the entire interaction is visible and searchable like a team Slack channel.

🧑‍💼 MVP Agent Team
Name	Role	Personality
Kai	Social Outreach	Confident, action-first
Nora	Copywriter	Creative, strategic
Lex	Analyst	Blunt, data-driven
Echo	Memory Logger	Calm, observational

Each has:

Unique base prompts

Specific task formats

Ability to pass outputs between each other

🏗️ System Architecture Overview
🌐 Frontend
React + TypeScript (Vite)

TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui for styling

Chat interface with Slack-like message layout

Command bar, agent list sidebar, and response threading

⚙️ Backend
NestJS (API server)

Supabase (auth + Postgres DB)

OpenAI API (GPT-4o for agent tasks)

Custom task router to parse messages and assign tasks by @mention

📁 Supabase Schema
Table	Purpose
agents	Stores agent metadata (role, name, prompt)
tasks	Logs each task sent and which agent executed it
messages	Stores all chat messages for the shared workspace
logs	Written by Echo — structured log entries from all actions
users	Supabase auth + profile

🎨 UX Vision
Left: Agent sidebar (like teammates)

Center: Group chat with all agents

Bottom: Natural language input bar

Right (optional): Activity feed (logs, memory, status)

Each message you send is like leading a team standup.
Each agent responds inline, like coworkers checking in.

🔮 Future-Ready Features
Feature	Stage
🗂️ Agent Templates	Post-launch
⏰ Task Scheduling	Post-launch
🌍 Agent Marketplace	Phase 2
🧠 Long-term Memory	Optional with Pinecone or Supabase pgvector
📱 Mobile App	Post-MVP
📡 Web scraping / browser automation	Add-on agent feature

🧪 MVP Milestone Plan
Stage	Goal
✅ Branding	Name, logo, palette
✅ Agent Definitions	Kai, Nora, Lex, Echo
🔜 Frontend Scaffold	Vite + Tailwind chat UI
🔜 Backend Setup	NestJS + Supabase structure
🔜 Core Logic	Message parser → agent executor → logger
🔜 MVP Release	Host on Vercel + Railway
🔜 Demo Campaign	Use Tavari to run its own launch outreach

🌟 Summary
Tavari is your AI workspace for digital teamwork.
It’s not a chatbot. It’s not a workflow builder.
It’s a collaborative team of intelligent agents that do real work — in real time — with you as their team lead.
